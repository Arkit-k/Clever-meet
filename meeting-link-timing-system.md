# 🔗 Meeting Link Timing System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ **Problem Solved:**

**Before**: Meeting links were visible immediately when meetings were confirmed, leading to confusion about when to join.

**After**: Meeting links are only visible **exactly 1 hour before** the scheduled meeting time, with smart timing controls and email reminders.

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **1. Time-Based Link Visibility**
```
Meeting scheduled for: Tomorrow 10:00 AM
Link becomes available: Tomorrow 9:00 AM (exactly 1 hour before)
Email reminder sent: Tomorrow 9:00 AM (when link becomes available)
```

### **2. Visual States**

#### **🔒 BEFORE 1 Hour (Link Pending)**
- **Badge**: Orange "AVAILABLE IN X MIN"
- **Message**: "Meeting link will be available 1 hour before the meeting"
- **Display**: Countdown timer showing when link will be ready
- **Actions**: None (link hidden)

#### **🔓 AFTER 1 Hour (Link Ready)**
- **Badge**: Green "AVAILABLE NOW"
- **Message**: "Your meeting link is now available. Click to join the meeting."
- **Display**: Full meeting URL with copy/join buttons
- **Actions**: Copy Link, Join Meeting

#### **🔴 DURING Meeting (Join Now)**
- **Badge**: Red "HAPPENING NOW"
- **Message**: "Meeting is starting now!"
