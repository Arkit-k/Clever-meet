   - **Events**: Select `BOOKING_CREATED` (and optionally `BOOKING_CANCELLED`)
   - **Active**: ‚úÖ Enabled

### 2. Test the Integration

1. **Go to your Cal.com booking page** (e.g., `https://cal.com/your-username/15min`)
2. **Book a test meeting** as if you were a client
3. **Check your app**:
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000/auth/signin`

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ngrok URL Changes
The current ngrok URL `https://4b008e700e9f.ngrok-free.app` will change when you restart ngrok. 

**For production**, you need to:
1. Deploy your app to Vercel/Netlify/etc.
2. Use the permanent URL in Cal.com webhook settings

### üîß Troubleshooting

**If webhooks aren't working:**

1. **Check ngrok is running**: The terminal with ngrok should still be active
2. **Check webhook logs**: Look at your app console for webhook messages
3. **Test webhook manually**:
   ```bash
   node test-webhook-external.js
   ```
4. **Verify Cal.com webhook settings**: Make sure the URL is correct and events are selected

### üéØ What Happens When Someone Books

1. **Client books** on your Cal.com page
2. **Cal.com sends webhook** to your app
3. **App creates meeting** with PENDING status
4. **Freelancer gets notification** (if configured)
5. **Freelancer can approve/decline** in dashboard
6. **Both parties can collaborate** in meeting room once approved

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Cal.com webhook** (follow steps above)
2. **Test with real booking**
3. **Deploy to production** for permanent URL
4. **Configure email notifications** (optional)

## Current Webhook URL
```
https://4b008e700e9f.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/cal
```

**Remember**: This URL changes when ngrok restarts!
